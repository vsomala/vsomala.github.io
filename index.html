                            <div class="subheading mb-4"> Capstone Project: </div> I studied the macroeconomic impacts of New Member States’ joining the EU during the expansion of the European Union in the 2000s. Using the World Input-Output database created by the researchers in the European Commission, I aimed to find if the New Member States (NMSs) experienced significant changes in their industry formation and organization of their value chain network. I worked on this economic research paper with classmate, Daijiro Yokota. 
                            <p></p>
                            <p> Findings: The two variables I focused on were NMS’ export dependence on the EU and NMS’ industry specialization. My results showed that New Member States responded to the treatment of being in the EU by becoming more dependent as an exporter on the EU markets and also became more specialized in labor intensive rather than capital intensive industries. The increased dependence on the EU creates opportunities and also has drawbacks. On the one hand, NMS can piggyback on the growth of the EU and foster growth through channels like spillover effects, FDI, and increased trade. On the other hand, being more dependent on the EU and participating more in the Global Value Chain network leaves the NMS more sensitive to global shocks and seemingly distant regional shocks in the world. Specializing in labor intensive industries also keeps them in a vulnerable position of relying on a comparative advantage in labor, which historically has been one that is unreliable in the long run.

                        Predicting Airbnb Prices Using Machine Learning. The ultimate goal of our analysis is to build a predictive model of price and to understand the listing features with which this might be associated. Some features used to model price are square feet, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, neighborhood, property type and more. I used KNN algorithm and the Lasso model to build the model.

                        Can we predict a song's genre based on its acoustic properties and the year it was made? I used the same dataset gathered from Spotify API to build a machine learning model that guesses a song’s genre based on its properties and artist information. I try a few different techniques and talk through the benefits and drawbacks of each.

                        What makes a song popular? Can we predict a song’s popularity base only on its acoustic properties (eg: how fast it is, how loud it is, etc)? To answer these questions, we’ll analyze a sample of 10,000 songs that play on Spotify. Along with the popularity of each song, the music data set contains lots of acoustic variables. Using these variables, we use ML techniques to model popularity.

                        We built an algorithm that automatically flags incoming news stories as “fake” or “real” based on the following information; title, contents, authors, sources, and the URL of the article. Using 182 articles from 2016 flagged “fake” or “real”, we first made 15 predictor variables from the information to build the model. In this process, we used function to read the texts and detect the sentiment of the words in the texts. Next, we used LASSO to select the variables to include in the model.

                            <p>🏔️ Recently, I've gotten into mountaineering. This past winter, I trekked the Annapurna range and made it to the Base Camp, which is over 4000 meters or 13,550 feet above sea level. Accompanied by a professional guide, the trek took a total of seven days over which I became close with my guide and still call every month or two!</p>
                                
                            <p>🏺 A year ago, I started getting back into ceramics. Previously, I'd only had experience throwing on the wheel and was eager to learn different methods. While abroad in South Africa, I had the opportunity to work at a ceramics studio in a cultural center. I shadowed the technicians at the studio and learned how to create mold plasters, shape the clay mold, fire the clay in a klin, and finally paint and glaze the piece.</p>
                            
                            <p>📻 This past year, I created and hosted a radio show with my friend, Daijiro Yokota, aimed at sharing and educating listeners on music from different cultures. Every week, an international student from our school would join the show and showcase music from their culture, explain the role music plays, and share personal stories. </p>
                        
                            <p class="mb-0"> 📽️ I'm currently working on a short video documentary project about Artists working in Guga S'thebe, an Arts and Cultural center in the Langa Township, South Africa. The documentary is aimed at capturing the artist's vision, motivation, perspective, and how the space/art has empowered them. Some topics include life post-apartheid, the continued lack of economic freedom for black and colored peoples in South Africa, the meaning of their art, and how the space is being used to give back to the community. </p>
